Rules
=====

- The submitted program passing the most test cases wins.
- In case of a tie, the program passing the CI build first wins.
- Of course, you cannot alter the test cases :)

## A few more things

- New test cases will be added over time.
- As in real life, requirements may change, so be ready to alter and adapt you program just a tiny bit.
